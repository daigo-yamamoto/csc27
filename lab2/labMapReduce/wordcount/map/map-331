He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all

added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing

drew him oftener from home than anything
