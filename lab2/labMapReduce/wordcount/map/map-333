that, by his wife at least,
if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this

"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear

reputation which her marriage had given her.

Though Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
