and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness

and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
little time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better."

With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately,
that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my
