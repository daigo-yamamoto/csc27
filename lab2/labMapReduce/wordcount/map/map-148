a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed

me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
me."
