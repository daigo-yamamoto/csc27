Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs
were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her

Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.

"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by
her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
would happen. But
